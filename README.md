### Project Descriptions (more detailed descriptions coming soon)

My main interest currently is the application of machine learning (Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning) for tuning and optimizing systems software, in particular, Linux sub-systems and compilers.

* Tuning NICs (Network cards): https://github.com/TreeinRandomForest/nic-tuning-experiments.
* Tuning gcc compiler parameters: https://github.com/TreeinRandomForest/gccoptim
* Code examples for Kubeflow book draft: https://github.com/TreeinRandomForest/kubeflow_usecases
* Short-course on ML for software engineers at Red Hat: https://github.com/TreeinRandomForest/BrnoMLWorkshop2019
